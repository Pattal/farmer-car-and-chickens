# farmer-car-and-chickens

Description:

You are the farmer who runs away from his chickens.
You run away by car, you have to avoid water and obstacles, you lose some fuel after each hit and there is a chance that one of the chickens will jump on the hood of your car. Your pets are very fat, so the chicken on the hood takes 4 times more fuel than normal, so you have to get rid of it as soon as possible, e.g. by hitting something. After you get rid of the chicken, fuel consumption returns to normal and you gain 10 points. From time to time, an obstacle will appear on the map that he will have to jump over, you can jump by pressing SPACE, but be careful because it costs 10 points. You can earn additional points by collecting carrots, and you can keep the plum supply from the canisters lying on the route. 

Good luck and don't get caught by the soaked poultry!
